===========

Host the Docs is a simple way to host static code documentation. Its main use is as a self-hosted server for your organization's private documentation. Better alternatives are available for open source projects, such as Read the Docs or Github Pages.

Host the Docs was created after a long day of banging my head against the wall trying to get Read the Docs set up with private GitHub repositories, and having developed a plugin to get it to work with Perforce. What the world needed was a way to easily host documentation from several projects, from any source, that could build documentation on an individual basis.

Seriously, let other people generate their own docs, I just want to Host the Docs!
